\section{Conclusion}
In this report, we have discussed the parallelisability of spheres. We first showed that no even dimensional sphere is capable of admitting such a parallelisation and in doing so, proved the famous Hairy Ball Theorem. We showed that odd dimensional spheres, $\mathbb{S}^1$, $\mathbb{S}^3$ and $\mathbb{S}^7$ do admit parallelisations. As stated in the previous section, we claimed that these are indeed the only parallelisable spheres but in order to actually show that $\mathbb{S}^n$ for $n=1,3,7$ are indeed the only cases, we must refer to the work of Milnor and Bott, or Hirzebruch and Kervaire or Adams. We have also briefly discussed the relationship between these parallelisable spheres and the existence to division algebras and related results.
